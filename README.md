# Wyvern Plugin - A Starter Plugin for WordPress

## Setup Instructions
I don't have full setup instructions yet for things like creating blocks or adding custom post types as this
is still a work in progress. I'll updated the instructions when I feel like things are in a good place.

## Notes
- **1/23/2020**: Today's update is the result of a refactor of the examples. The ones I was using were coming 
  out of the [Block Editor Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/tutorials/), and frankly
  they're just not very helpful. The Handbook barely explains anything, and once you get into Dynamic Blocks
  things start to get a little wonky. Trying to stick to them cost me 2 full days of debugging before I 
  finally moved on. Many thanks to [@royboy789](https://github.com/royboy789) for his help in figuring
  everything out!

  I'd also like to thank [@davidyeiser](https://github.com/davidyeiser) for his Gutenberg tutorials. I came
  across them today and they were massively helpful in better understanding the different aspects of blocks.
  I've switched over to using his tutorials as the example blocks because they're MUCH clearer examples.

- **1/24/2020**: Today's update adds what I was trying to accomplish most of the week with Roy's help. Yesterday's
  refactor gave me a lot of clarity, as did [@yingles](https://github.com/yingles) tutorial on [Building
  Dynamic Blocks](https://jasonyingling.me/building-dynamic-blocks-for-the-gutenberg-editor-in-wordpress/). As
  a result of Jason's tutorial, I was able to add in support for attributes on the PHP side of a block.
